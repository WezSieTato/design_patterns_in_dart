# Design patterns (GoF) using Dart language

## Creational design patterns

### Abstract Factory

Still have to find a way to print some object it pointed by a reference.

### Prototype

There is a nice way of creating objects with a named constructor just like with static factory methods in Java.

### Builder

There is no support for inner classes.

### Factory Method

This one can be done using factory constructor.

### Singleton

This singleton implementation utilizes lazy loading of global variables.
There is also a way of implementing a singleton with a factory constructor that always returns the same instance.

## Behavioural design patterns


## Structural design patterns
