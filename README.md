## Creational design patterns

### Abstract Factory

Still have to find a way to print some object it pointed by a reference.

### Prototype

There is a nice way of creating objects with a named constructor just like with static factory methods in Java.

### Builder

There is no support for inner classes.

### Factory Method

### Singleton
